<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>My name is Joshua King and I'm from Augusta, Maine. I graduated from Cony High School in the spring of 2017 in a class of 125. Currently, I'm studying as a business finance major at the University of Maine. My favorite hobbies are playing soccer, going kayaking, and kicking back and enjoying a good movie with the boys. I come from a family with a long history of being Black Bears. My entire family on my dad's side are UMaine grads and my sister also is attending the university in the nursing program.</p>
