<h2>Kayaking</h2>

<p1>There's nothing like taking a few friends and going kayaking. Whether or not you like a relaxing paddle on pond or a work out riding down the rapids there's something for everyone. It's also super relaxing, you can sit back and enjoy nature. Another huge part of kayaking that I think is awesome is the fact that you can get away from everything and take a breath in peace by yourself.

<h3>Traveling</h3>

<p2>Every since I was little my family and I have done a decent bit of traveling around the United States. I've been out in the midwest and all up and down the east coast. The only time that we've traveled off of the continental U.S. was to go Puerto Rico; it was unlike any where I'd ever been to before. Nothing was the same there, the food, language, and culture were all entirely different from what we have here in Maine, and I only listed few of the differences. This coming summer I'm planning on going to the country of Laos to volunteer on an animal reserve. It'd be my first time leaving this hemisphere and I couldn't be more excited. I can't wait to see the new culture!
