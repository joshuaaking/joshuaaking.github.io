<h1>My Summer Job</h1>
<p1>This summer I had my first official job! I worked at a pizza and sandswitch shop called College Carry Out, I was a delivery driver. As a person who drives around town bringing people food, you meet all sorts of people and it was really cool experience meeting people from all different walks of life. Also it was great because I got to experience the customer service side of business as well as the financial side, having to handle the money from the transactions. As delivery drives our job wasn't only to drop off food, we did pretty much everything around the shop other than actually making the food. Which meant we stayed relatively busy, making long shifts go along quickly.
