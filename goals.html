<h1>My goals</h1>
<p1>As of now I have relatively wide standing goals. My long term goals are to graduate college, get a job that I enjoy, and to develop more as a person. Each of those are based around two of my ideals and that is self improvement and personal happiness. If I'm able to reach and achieve these goals I believe that overall I'll be a better person and a helpful and contributing person in society.
