<h1>My Hometown</h1>
<p1>I was born in Augusta, Maine and have lived here all my life.  Even though it's the capital, it still has this small town atmosphere. All my friends lived close by and I didn't have more than a three minute drive to all of the schools that I attended. Furthermore, the neighborhood where I lived my peaceful and safe, most of the inhabitants were either families or elderly people.

<h2>My Early Education</h2>
<p2>Throughout my younger years I only ever attended two different schools; Hussey Elementary school, grades K-6 and Cony High School 7-12. I got to know pretty much all of my classmates and teachers at one point or another. Furthermore, growing up I always tried my hardest and worked hard to try and get all As, which is something that I am very proud of when I think back on it. It gave me a good footing for when classes started to get hard and the materials began to get more challenging.
