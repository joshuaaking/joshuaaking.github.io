<h1>My Hometown</h1>
<p1>I was born in Augusta, Maine and have lived here all my life.  Even though it's the capital, it still has this small town atmosphere. All my friends lived close by and I didn't have more than a three minute drive to all of the schools that I attended. Furthermore, the neighborhood where I lived my peaceful and safe, most of the inhabitants were either families or elderly people.

<h2>My home</h2>
<p2>My family moved into my childhood home when I was just a baby and that's been what I've called home all my life. My house was a simple two story ranch styled home and has a nice sized backyard. Over the years we've had an arrangement of pets, right now we have two dogs and three cats.
